### Familiarise yourself with the application
We've built a simple express server for you. Time to get familiar!
```bash
cd app
ls
```
You can see a number of files, and everything is already installed. Check the contents of `app.mjs`, this is where the server code resides. Let's spin up the server to make sure that it works!
```bash
node app.mjs
```
In order to test it, open up a new terminal by pressing the + beside Tab1, and send a request:
```bash
curl localhost:3000
```
You should see a welcoming message! Alright, we're now set to move on to the tutorial.
