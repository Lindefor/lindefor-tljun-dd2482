# Using Docker and Kubernets with RBAC and Kubernetes secrets
### Executable Tutorial

This tutorial provides a guide to building, containerizing, and deploying a Node.js application using Docker and Kubernetes on a single local system. It also includes steps to set up Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes and use Kubernetes secrets to store sensitive information.

The tutorial is divided into the following steps:

`Step 1:` Inspect the Node.js Application

`Step 2:` Configure, build and run a Docker container

`Step 3:` Set up a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube

`Step 4:` Scale the application by increasing the number of replicas

`Step 5:` Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes

`Step 6:` Add secrets to Kubernetes to store sensitive information

`Step 7:` Summary and Conclusion
